Heapify: Rearrange a heap to maintain the heap property, that is, the key of the root node is more extreme (greater or less) than or equal to the keys of its children.

Heapify is the process of converting a binary tree into a Heap data structure. A binary tree being a tree data structure where each node has at most two child nodes. ... A Heap must also satisfy the heap-order property, the value stored at each node is greater than or equal to it's children.
